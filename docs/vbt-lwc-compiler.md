There are essentially three VBT compilers available.  

1.  A “[[Local Compiler]]" which is more complex to set up..
2.  A [[Puppeteer-based "compiler"]] which compiles code “in the cloud” using the Omniscript managed package.
3.  The upcoming (?) “Standard OmniStudio Runtime” which, I guess, requires some code porting (?)

We went with option 2 because it was simpler and more similar to the end-goal of cloud-based auto-compilation.
